    <h2>JSX</h2>
    <p>
      JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows us to
      write HTML in React. It is useful for describing what the UI should look
      like and produces React 'elements'

    <h2>Components</h2>

      Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and

      elements describing what should appear on the screen.

    <h2>Hooks</h2>

      You may have noticed the use of useState instead of this.state in the

      hook‚Äîthe other popular hook is the useEffect hook, which replaces
      componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentDidUnmount.

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>
      A nice way to interact with arrays is through higher-order functions.
      Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as
      arguments or return functions as their results. Higher-order functions
      allow programmers to write more elegant code. An example of a higher-order
      function would be the map() method. The map() method creates a new array
      populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element
      in the calling array.
